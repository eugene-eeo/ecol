Introduction & Definitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our project would be to implement an algorithm for edge colouring, and analyse
 how the output changes for different kinds of graphs - in particular random
 graphs.
 An extended goal would be to analyse colouring for graphs which have a
 small number of vertices with maximum degree.
 Some of the many applications of edge colouring are round-robin tournament
 scheduling
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-7"

\end_inset

, as well as link scheduling for TDMA network protocols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of the link scheduling problem is as follows; we have 4 devices
 which are linked to some number of other devices.
 They want to communicate with one another, but if two devices communicate
 with the same one at the same time, their signals will interfere with one
 another.
 One solution to this is to allow communication between different pairs
 of devices every time period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, in such a way so two devices won't communicate with the same device in
 the same time period; after 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 of these periods, all devices would have communicated to one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we represent this as a graph, with the vertices being the devices and
 the edges being 
\begin_inset Formula $\{uv:\text{{u\,can\,communicate\,with\,v\}}}$
\end_inset

, then the problem of minimising 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the same as that of computing the chromatic index of this graph.

 - a 
\series bold
graph
\series default
 is a pair 
\begin_inset Formula $G=(V,E)$
\end_inset

 of vertices and edges, where 
\begin_inset Formula $E\subseteq V^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In our study we only consider cases where 
\begin_inset Formula $|V|$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $|E|$
\end_inset

 are finite.
 The

degree
\series default

 An

\end_inset

 is a set of colours, such that for all pairs of distinct edges 
\begin_inset Formula $e,f\in E$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 share a common vertex then

\end_inset

.
 The 
\series bold
chromatic index
\series default
 of a graph, 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi'(G)$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Theorems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The foundation of edge colouring is Vizing's Theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-4"

\end_inset

, which establishes a tight lower and upper bound on the chromatic index
 of any (simple) graph.
 Vizing's Theorem states that 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall G,\,\Delta(G)\leq\chi'(G)\leq\Delta(G)+1$
\end_inset

.
 As mentioned previously, graphs which only need 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 colours are in Class 1, and those that need 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta+1$
\end_inset

 in Class 2.
 It was shown that determining whether a graph is in Class 1 or Class 2
 is NP-Complete
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-5"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some graph classes do have polynomial time algorithms to compute a proper
 and optimal edge colouring (and by extension, determine if the graph is
 in Class 1/2).
 For instance, Behzad et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-6"

\end_inset

 used a simple construction with addition of edges modulo 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 to show that the chromatic index for 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{n}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is even, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is odd and 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq3$
\end_inset

 (the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

 is trivial).
 For bipartite graphs, there is KÅ‘nig's Theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

: 
\emph on
The chromatic index of any bipartite graph is equal to its maximum degree;
 
\emph default
i.e.
 every bipartite graph is Class 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In proofs of both Konig's and Vizing's theorem, a common technique used
 is the path switching method.
 It is used when an edge cannot be coloured using one of the free colours
 of its endpoints.
 (The 
\emph on
free
\emph default
 colours at some node 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 refer to the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C\,}\backslash\,\{\gamma:uv\in E(G),\,\varphi(uv)=\gamma\}$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given two colours 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta\in\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 being the set of colours), we use 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\varphi}[\alpha,\beta]$
\end_inset

 to denote the subgraph of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 induced by only the edges which have been coloured 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

.
 Every component of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\varphi}[\alpha,\beta]$
\end_inset

 is either an even-cycle or a path.
 By properly selecting 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and exchanging the colours along some component (usually a path) in 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\varphi}[\alpha,\beta]$
\end_inset

, we free up one of previously forbidden 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 to be used at a vertex while maintaining validity of the colouring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algorithm to be implemented as part of our project will be Misra and
 Gries's algorithm
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-9"

\end_inset

 that uses colouring fans.
 An alternative algorithm exists that isn't based on colouring fans, but
 rather counting arguments was discovered by Ehrenfeucht et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-10"

\end_inset

, which might be implemented as part of our project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results for other Graph Classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though Misra and Gries's algorithm will yield 
\emph on
good enough
\emph default
 results - since the upper bound on colours used is at worst, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta+1$
\end_inset

; there exists specialised algorithms to decide whether graphs are in Class
 1/2 for certain graph classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of deciding whether a graph is in Class 1 or 2- known as the
 Graph Classification Problem still has unknown complexity for many well-studied
 graph classes
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-12"

\end_inset

- the most surprising being co-graphs (graphs which are 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{4}$
\end_inset

-free).
 Among a series of papers to investigate this problem, Vizing
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-16"

\end_inset

 proved that every graph in Class 2 has at least 3 vertices of maximum degree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ErdÅ‘s and Wilson
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-11"

\end_inset

 proved that 
\emph on
almost every simple random graph is Class 1
\emph default
.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{G\mathrm{(n,p)}}$
\end_inset

 is the probability space consisting of graphs of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 vertices, and each possible edge is included independently with probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, then almost every graph in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{G\mathrm{(n,\frac{1}{2})}}$
\end_inset

 has 1 unique vertex of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 and is in Class 1.
 In particular, as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $P(n)=U_{n}/V_{n}\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the number of class 1 graphs and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the total number of graphs with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 vertices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth noting that a method to determine whether a graph is Class 1/2
 is by looking at structural properties of the core and semi-core of the
 graph.
 For example, Fournier
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-8"

\end_inset

 proved that if the core 
\begin_inset Formula $G[\Lambda_{G}]$
\end_inset

 of a graph has no cycles, then 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is Class 1 - this is consistent with Vizing's findings, since two vertices
 cannot produce a cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another result from Machado and de Figueiredo
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-2"

\end_inset

 builds on the previous result and shows that the chromatic index for a
 graph is equal to the chromatic index of it's semi-core.
 These results would benefit our project when we investigate graphs where
 
\begin_inset Formula $|\Lambda_{G}|\leq k$
\end_inset

 - we should bound 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq3$
\end_inset

, and we know that if there is a cycle induced by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{G}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 may be in Class 2.
 Another nice consequence of this is that we only have to investigate connected
 graphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For planar graphs with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\geq8$
\end_inset

, it is shown by Chrobrak et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-13,key-14"

\end_inset

 that the colours needed is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

, and we can compute such a colouring in polynomial time - 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n\log n)$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\geq9$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n)$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\geq19$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the well known family of partial 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-trees, which are subgraphs of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-trees, there is a polynomial-time algorithm by Zhou et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-15"

\end_inset

 to compute the minimal edge colouring for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 A 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-tree is defined recursively as follows

\begin_layout Section
Random Graph Generation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a variety of random graph models - the most commonly studied model
 being the ErdÅ‘sâ€“RÃ©nyi model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-17"

\end_inset

, also known as the binomial graphs model â€“ 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{G\mathrm{(n,p)}}$
\end_inset

 is the probability space consisting of graphs of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 vertices, and each possible edge is included independently with probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another model is the BarabÃ¡siâ€“Albert Preferential Attachment model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-18"

\end_inset

, which has 3 parameters: 
\begin_inset Formula $n,m,m_{0}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq m_{0}\geq m$
\end_inset

.
 A graph is generated as follows: we start with 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{m_{0}}$
\end_inset

, and then we add 
\begin_inset Formula $n-m_{0}$
\end_inset

 nodes one by one as follows: each new node being added is attached to 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 random existing nodes.
 The probability that the new node is connected to node 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula ${\textstyle {\displaystyle p_{i}}=d(i)/\sum_{j}d(j)}$
\end_inset

.
 This accurately simulates the growth of many real-life networks, such as
 citation networks and the graph of hyperlinks on the internet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also some algorithms
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-19"

\end_inset

 for generating 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-regular graphs - graphs which vertices all have degree 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, but there seems to be very few if not no results on generating graphs
 with certain forbidden subgraphs or graphs that have certain induced subgraph(s
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a start, we would implement the algorithm by Misra and Gries
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-9"

\end_inset

.
 Then we would test the colours needed on a number of random graphs generated
 using the binomial graph model 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{G\mathrm{(n,p)}}$
\end_inset

 - maybe parameterized over different values of both 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 When computing an edge colouring for graphs, as mentioned before Machado
 et al's results
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-2"

\end_inset

 help us greatly since we need only colour the semi-core of the graph instead
 of the full graph â€“ this would speed up the time needed for those tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We would then randomly generate graphs where 
\begin_inset Formula $|\Lambda_{G}|\leq k$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $|\Lambda_{G}|\ll|N_{G}(\Lambda_{G})|$
\end_inset

) and check if any of them need 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta+1$
\end_inset

 colours by the algorithm; should any such graphs appear, we would investigate
 their structure further.
 Note that since we are computing the colouring using an algorithm that
 makes no guarantees about optimality, we cannot state any rigorous results
 (e.g.
 that such graphs are definitely in Class 1/2), however it would maybe serve
 as a good exploratory study in this field.
